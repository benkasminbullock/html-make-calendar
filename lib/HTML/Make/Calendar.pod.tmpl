=head2 calendar

    my $out = calendar (year => 2010, month => 10);

=over

=item cdata

Callback data, see L</dayc>.

=item dayc

Day callback. If this is omitted, a default element is added. The day
callback is called with three arguments, first L</cdata>, second the
date as a hash reference with arguments C<year>, C<month> and C<dom>
(day of month, a number from 1 to 31), and third the HTML element to
attach the return value to, representing the cell of the calendar.

    &{$dayc} ($cdata, {year => 2020, month => 12, day => 21}, $td);

where C<$td> is an L<HTML::Make> object.

=item month

The month, as a number from 1 to 12. If the month is omitted, the
current month is used as given by L<Date::Calc/Today>.

=item year

The year, as a four-digit number like C<2020>. If the year is omitted,
the current year is used, as given by L<Date::Calc/Today>.
